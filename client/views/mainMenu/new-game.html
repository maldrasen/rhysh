          <div class='knight'>
            <p>
              The Black Knight is a fearsome armored warrior whose defensive fighting style is focused on disabling
              opponents with grappling techniques and counter attacks. While his persistent fear aura keeps his
              followers in line, it also ensures that he will always be more feared than loved.
            </p>
            <p class='requirements'>Male Only</p>
            <p class='note'>
              The Order of Excalpia is rather regressive and only allow men to join their ranks.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class='slaver hide'>
            <p>
              The Slavers are cruel and cunning rogues who prefer to attack from the shadows, letting their many
              slaves put themselves in danger while they uses their skills to cripple their opponents.
            </p>
            <p class='requirements'>Elf, Orc, Lupin, or Satyr Only</p>
            <p class='note'>
              The profession requires a strong and agile physique. While the dragonkind are physical enough for the
              work, they consider it beath them.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class='cultist hide'>
            <p>
              The Cultists of Rahm are feared across the world for their ability to capture and convert people to their
              strange eldritch religion. Their unspeakable gods grant them otherworldly powers but require sacrifice to
              remain in their favor.
            </p>
            <p class='requirements'>Elf, Nymph, Dragonkind, or Satyr Only</p>
            <p class='note'>
              A cultist must have a strong natural affinity to magic in order to attract the attention of the nameless
              gods.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class='mindbender hide'>
            <p>
              The Mindbenders pursue a dangerous school of mind control magics that have been banned in most civilised
              nations. While they also learn some telekinetic spells for basic defense their real power comes from
              their fanatically devoted followers.
            </p>
            <p class='requirements'>Elf, Nymph, Dragonkind, or Satyr Only</p>
            <p class='note'>
              The mindbender's spells require a strong natural affinity to magic to learn.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class='dominatrix hide'>
            <p>
              The Dominatrix delights in the suffering of others, learning a variety of skills to both inflict pain and
              to inspire people to worship her. She is an agile and deadly combatant when she chooses to be, though
              often she'd let her devoted slaves do the fighting for her.
            </p>
            <p class='requirements'>Female or Futanari Only</p>
            <p class='note'>
              The skills and techniques of the dominatrix is passed from mistress to slave, and it is forbidden to
              train a man.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class='chosen hide'>
            <p>
              The eldritch gods of the Cult of Rahm have chosen this one to be a vessel. While the cultists act as a
              conduit for the unspeakable gods' power, a Chosen One is the physical embodiment of corruption. They
              wield many of the same otherworldly powers, though often in a more physical way.
            </p>
            <p class='requirements'>Male or Futanari Only</p>
            <p class='note'>
              There are some who theorise that the nameless gods choose their vessels based on dick size alone.

        </ul>

        <div class='descriptions'>

          <div class='elf'>
            Strong, agile, naturally magical, and long lived, it's easy to see why the elves have become the dominant
            species now that the humans have gone extinct. The other species see the elves as arrogant and cruel, a
            reputation that isn't undeserving as most of the other species had been enslaved by the elves at some point
            in their histories.
          </div>

          <div class='nymph hide'>
            The nymphs are a race of nature spirits known for their unquenchable sexual appetites. Over the course of
            their long lives they develop animalistic traits, usually a tail or ears, that reflect their
            personalities. While there are no male nymphs, a few become futanari who (along with their large harems)
            keep the nymph population stable.
          </div>

          <div class='orc hide'>
            The orcs are a species of proud nomadic warriors. The bad blood between orcs and elves, the result of
            centuries of enslavement by the elves, keeps most orcs from ever leaving their tribal lands. Those that do
            are highly sought after by the guilds for their strength, skill, and inexhaustible stamina.
          </div>

          <div class='minotaur hide'>
            The minotaurs were created long ago in yet another attempt by the ancient elven magi to create the perfect
            slave race. Though their heads are distinctly bull shaped, with long horns and thick necks, from the waist
            down they're far more horse like, with everything that implies.
          </div>

          <div class='dragonkind hide'>
            The dragonkind are the most naturally gifted of all the civilized people. In addition to being magically
            adept and blessed with the ability to breathe fire and having naturally armored bodies, they are stronger,
            faster, and toughter than almost all the other species. Only their distrust of their fellow dragonkind
            keeps their power in check.
          </div>

          <div class='lupin hide'>
            The lupin were once elves, but the curse of the moon goddess has turned them into unnaturally strong wolf
            like creatures. The curse gives them the ability to quickly heal from most wounds, but on the full moon of
            every month they enter into a murderous rage that compells them to consume someone close to them.
          </div>

          <div class='satyr hide'>
            The only things that the satyr take seriously are hedonism and debauchery. They share many traits in
            common with their cousins the nymphs, though they tend to prefer a more physical than magical approach.
            Many cities forbid satyrs from entering due to their inhibition lowering auras that have a tendency to
            leave orgies in their wake.
