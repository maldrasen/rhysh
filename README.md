# Rhysh
A lewd dungeon crawler inspired by old school party based RPGs such as Wizardry, Etrian Odyssey, and the Shin Megami Tensei series. While it's not a "porn game" in that it's purpose is to be an RPG first, the content of the game would definately fall into the hard 18+ category and will contain subject matter that pretty much everyone will find objectionable in one way or another. I'm still in the early phases of development, and no where close to having what could be considered a playable game.
